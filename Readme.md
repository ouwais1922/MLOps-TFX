The pothole detection project utilizing the YOLOv7 model aims to automatically
identify and locate potholes on streets. The project involves deploying small
detection devices in each car, allowing real-time detection of potholes. In the
context of Morocco, such a project can be highly relevant. Morocco, like many
other countries, faces challenges related to road maintenance and infrastructure
development. Potholes are a common issue on Moroccan roads, which can lead
to accidents, damage to vehicles, and inconvenience for drivers and pedestrians.
